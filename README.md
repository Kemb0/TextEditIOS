# TextEditIOS
Basic Godot Project and iOS export data to test text swipe input on a TextEdit node.

Please feel free to give me a shout here or on Godot Forum, username: Kemb0. Happy to help test anything or modify these files if not set up as needed.

Folder SwipeTextEdit contains the Godot project containing one TextEdit node for text input.
Folder SwipeTextEditExportiOS contains the exported iOS project.

This hasn't been imported in to XCode as unsure if that was desired.
